;This is Beng's Shrubbery Fix Mod that modified by n5p29
;As the original mod, the trees can be burned again, missing shrubberies also
;fixed, and new burned tree effects. Trees also can be damaged by more damage
;types like explosions and poisons. But I modified it so trees will not damage
;surrounding units because may kill balances, and trees will not take damage
;against bullet weapons. I also fix some trees that changes into wrong models
;when burned or damaged.

; these kind of trees are changed to GenericTree rather than GenericOptTree
; so they can be burned

; Logic side computationally expensive tree. - but made cheaper by beng
